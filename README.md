# Deprecated
This package is no longer supported now that [webpack-init](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli) is live. Use that, it's great!

# webpack init
Initialize simple [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) config file

## Installation
To install the latest stable version:
```
npm install --save-dev webpack-init
```

## To Run
`webpack-init`

Once you run the command it will ask a series of questions and then once you have
selected your loaders it fires off a `node child process` to install all of those
for you.
